# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Solana IDE Core feature provides developers with a comprehensive desktop development environment specifically designed for Solana blockchain development. This feature transforms the basic Electron application into a full-featured IDE that supports Solana program development, testing, and deployment workflows. The IDE will include essential tools such as code editing with Solana-specific syntax highlighting, project management, integrated terminal, and Solana program compilation and testing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want a dedicated desktop IDE for Solana development, so that I can have all necessary tools in one integrated environment without switching between multiple applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a main IDE interface with menu bar, toolbar, sidebar, and main content area
2. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL load within 3 seconds on standard hardware
3. WHEN the IDE is running THEN the system SHALL provide native desktop integration including file associations and system notifications
4. IF the application crashes THEN the system SHALL automatically save user work and restore the previous session on restart

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want to create and manage Solana projects, so that I can organize my code and maintain multiple programs efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "New Project" THEN the system SHALL provide templates for different Solana program types (anchor, native, token programs)
2. WHEN creating a new project THEN the system SHALL generate the appropriate directory structure and configuration files
3. WHEN a user opens an existing project THEN the system SHALL load the project structure in the sidebar file explorer
4. WHEN a project is loaded THEN the system SHALL detect and display Solana-specific files (*.rs, Anchor.toml, Cargo.toml) with appropriate icons
5. IF a project contains invalid configuration THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested fixes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want advanced code editing capabilities with Solana-specific features, so that I can write programs efficiently with proper syntax support and IntelliSense.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing Rust files THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for Solana-specific macros and attributes
2. WHEN typing code THEN the system SHALL offer auto-completion for Solana program library functions and types
3. WHEN hovering over Solana types THEN the system SHALL display documentation and type information
4. WHEN saving a file THEN the system SHALL automatically format the code according to Rust standards
5. IF there are compilation errors THEN the system SHALL display inline error markers with detailed error messages
6. WHEN editing Anchor programs THEN the system SHALL provide specific IntelliSense for Anchor framework features

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want integrated build and compilation tools, so that I can compile my programs without leaving the IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user triggers build THEN the system SHALL compile the Solana program using the appropriate toolchain
2. WHEN compilation starts THEN the system SHALL display build progress in a dedicated output panel
3. WHEN compilation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display success message and generated artifacts location
4. IF compilation fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages with clickable links to problematic code locations
5. WHEN building Anchor programs THEN the system SHALL generate IDL files and display them in the project structure
6. WHEN a user requests clean build THEN the system SHALL remove all build artifacts and rebuild from scratch

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want an integrated terminal, so that I can run Solana CLI commands and other development tools without switching applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the terminal THEN the system SHALL provide a fully functional terminal interface within the IDE
2. WHEN the terminal opens THEN the system SHALL automatically set the working directory to the current project root
3. WHEN running Solana CLI commands THEN the system SHALL display command output with proper formatting and colors
4. WHEN a user types commands THEN the system SHALL provide auto-completion for common Solana CLI commands
5. IF a command produces errors THEN the system SHALL highlight error messages and provide clickable links where applicable
6. WHEN multiple terminals are needed THEN the system SHALL support multiple terminal tabs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want program testing capabilities, so that I can validate my programs work correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs tests THEN the system SHALL execute all test files and display results in a dedicated test panel
2. WHEN tests are running THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress and status updates
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL display pass/fail status with detailed output for failed tests
4. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clickable links to the failing test code
5. WHEN running Anchor tests THEN the system SHALL automatically start a local validator if needed
6. WHEN a user wants to debug tests THEN the system SHALL provide debugging capabilities with breakpoints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want workspace and session management, so that I can maintain my development context across IDE sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN closing the IDE THEN the system SHALL save the current workspace state including open files and layout
2. WHEN reopening the IDE THEN the system SHALL restore the previous workspace state automatically
3. WHEN switching between projects THEN the system SHALL save the current project state and load the target project state
4. WHEN a user has multiple files open THEN the system SHALL maintain tab order and active file selection
5. IF the IDE crashes THEN the system SHALL recover unsaved changes from auto-saved drafts on restart
6. WHEN a user customizes the layout THEN the system SHALL persist layout preferences across sessions
